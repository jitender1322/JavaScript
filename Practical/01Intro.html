    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
        <mark>When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name:
            “LiveScript”. But Java was very popular at that time, so it was decided
            that positioning a new language as a “younger brother” of Java would
            help. But as it evolved, JavaScript became a fully independent language
            with its own specification called ECMAScript, and now it has no relation
            to Java at all.</mark>

        console.log("Hi");
        console.log("Bye");
    </script>
